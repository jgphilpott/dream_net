# Dream Net

The Dream Net is a neural networking tool used to create visual art! It uses a technique known as '[neural style transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_Style_Transfer)' to blend images together. There are also a few online tools you can use such as the [Deep Dream Generator](https://deepdreamgenerator.com) if programming isn't your thing.

This project uses two pretrained [models from TensorFlow Hub](https://tfhub.dev/google/magenta/arbitrary-image-stylization-v1-256) to make the image generation process as simple and speedy as possible. If you want to take a deeper dive and learn how to build your own models from scratch I recommend [this tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/style_transfer).

For a more detailed introduction and a few examples take a look at [this short video](https://youtu.be/krihwKy9ckg).
